# Web Components POC

This project demonstrates how to create and use Web Components in two applications:
1. **Component Library Application**: Hosts reusable Web Components (e.g., buttons, modals).
2. **Consumer Application**: Imports and uses the Web Components from the Component Library.

Both applications are dockerized for easy setup and deployment.
